Implementation of the Bluetooth Transmitter via Arduino Uno (2017)

The topic of the project is Implementation of Bluetooth transmitter via Arduino and Bluetooth.
According to this basic, a car controlled by the positions of the fingers. The controlled data that
managed by the fingers were transmitted to the motors in the car. In detail, we aimed to control the
car with four different instructions which are turn left, turn right, go straight and turn around. To decide
these instructions, a glove with the flex sensors were designed. If the car is wanted to redirect
backward, the switch on the glove should be opened. In this project, transmission between two
Arduinos with Bluetooth was aimed. The flex sensor information were transmitted from the glove to
the car and, also, switch mode information were transmitted to the car for going back. This project
may be implemented in the real life such as controlling a wheel chair by a glove.
